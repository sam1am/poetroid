## What's Poetroid?

üñ® Print Poetic Visions: Each poem is instantly printed out on a thermal prinr for you to keep, scrapbook, or pin to the refrigerator.
üîß Off-the-shelf Heart: Built with accessible, DIY-friendly parts and a whole lot of love for the whole lot of you.

Poetroid consists of two parts: Server and Client. 

### Client Camera Device

The client is the camera (pictured above). It is powered by a Single Board Computer (SBC) running Linux and the software from the ./poetroid_device folder in this repo. 

*Installation:*

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sam1am/poetroid
cd poetroid/poetroid_debices
python3 -m venv poetroid-venv
source poetroid-venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python poetroid_app.py
```

### Server 

The server software (coming soon) can be run locally on the SBC (currently slow), or remotely on a more powerful machine with a GPU. 

## Parts and Libraries

Poetroid relies on a series of open-source libraries and models including:

- Tkinter
- Ollama
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- Llava (For vision. Configurable)
- Mistral (For poertry. Configurable)

Special thanks to the various open-source machine learning models (LLMs) and the supportive community on the `localllama` subreddit.
